Question 1:
A string S  said to be "Beautiful" if the following criteria is satisfied 
Take the string S and take its reverse. 
Take the absolute difference of ASCII values of adjacent characters in both the strings. 
If this list of absolute differences is the same for both the original string and its reverse.

Note: You should solve this without using any extra memory

Example
S = "lmnop"

The ASCII values of the characters of the original string are [108, 109, 110, 111, 112] and 
the ASCII values of the reversed string is [112, 111, 110, 109, 108]. The absolute differences of the adjacent elements for both strings are [1,1,1,1] , so the string is Beautiful.

Question 2:
Find the minimum platforms needed to avoid delay in the train arrival

Trains arrival   = {9:00, 9:40, 9:50, 11:00, 15:00, 18:00} 
Trains departure ={9:10, 12:00, 11:20, 11:30, 19:00, 20:00} 

Question 3:

In keypad handset, given the button presses, print the equivalent text message. A keypad handset has alphabets paired to number buttons. 2 is paired to "abc", 3 with "def", 4("ghi"), 5("jkl"), 6("mno"),7("pqrs"),8("tuv"),9("wxyz"). 0 is paired with space. # is pressed to type a character in uppercase. A button has to be pressed n number of times for the corresponding character to be typed. Eg: to type 'c', button 2 has to be pressed 3 times. Given the sequence of button presses, print the equivalent character. Assume that the input button sequence is meant for text message containing only alphabets.
Sample Input
